# Contributing to Open Source Friday

Want to contribute to Open Source Friday? That's great! Here are a couple of guidelines that will help you contribute. Before we get started: Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure that this project is a welcoming place for **everyone** to contribute to. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

#### Overview

* [Contribution workflow](#contribution-workflow)
* [Setup instructions](#setup-instructions)
* [Reporting a bug](#reporting-a-bug)
* [Additional info](#additional-info)

## Contribution workflow

 * Fork the project.
 * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
 * Add tests for it. This is important so we don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
 * Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

## Setup instructions

You can find in-depth instructions to install the correct Ruby version, Postgres, and to set up the database in our [README](https://github.com/ossfriday/ossfriday/blob/master/README.md#getting-started).

## Reporting a bug

So you've found a bug, and want to help us fix it? Before filing a bug report, please double-check the bug hasn't already been reported. You can do so [on our issue tracker](https://github.com/ossfriday/ossfriday/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug). If something hasn't been raised, you can go ahead and create a new issue with the following information:

* On which page did the error happen?
* How can the error be reproduced?
* If possible, please also provide an error message or a screenshot to illustrate the problem

If you want to be really thorough, there is a great overview on Stack Overflow of [what you should consider when reporting a bug](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/240323/how-to-report-bugs-the-smart-way).

It goes without saying that you're welcome to help investigate further and/or find a fix for the bug. If you want to do so, just mention it in your bug report and offer your help!

## Additional info

Especially if you're a newcomer to Open Source and you've found some little bumps along the way while contributing, we recommend you write about them. [Here](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/new-contributors-to-open-source-please-blog-more-920af14cffd)'s a great article about why writing about your experience is important; this will encourage other beginners to try their luck at Open Source, too!
