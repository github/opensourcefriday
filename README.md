# Open Source Friday

Contribute to open source every Friday :beers:

## What is this?

Open Source Friday is a movement to encourage companies, people and maintainers to contribute to open source every Friday :christmas_tree:

*Alternative name: 52 pull requests* ðŸ¤£

Some of the things that worked well for 24 Pull Requests that we'd like replicate:

- **opt-in for maintainers** - only suggesting projects that maintainers have suggested means we don't send a swarm of extra maintainer work to someone who doesn't want it or can't handle it.
- **wisdom of crowds** - if lots of people are doing the same thing at the same time more people will make an effort to join in
- **avoid rewards** - Getting free t-shirts or other kinds of gifts tends to bring out bad behaviour like PRs that change a single line of whitespace, which waste maintainers time and energy, the rewards should be a bit less tangible

Things we'd like to try:

- **not tied to pull requests** - there are lots of ways someone can contribute to an open source project that doesn't require opening a PR on GitHub, we should encourage things like documentation, issue triage, StackOverflow answering, support forum helping, event organising, blogging as well as code contributions

- **Three target audiences** - Individual contributors, maintainers and companies are the three types of audience we should be catering to, with documentation for each one on how to get involved.

## Development

Source hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/ossfriday/ossfriday).
Report issues/feature requests on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ossfriday/ossfriday/issues).

### Getting Started

Register a [new GitHub OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

* Set the homepage to `http://localhost:3000`.
* Set the authorization callback URL to `http://localhost:3000/users/auth/github/callback`.

Create the config file for the client ID and secret generated for your GitHub OAuth application:

```
cp config/application.example.yml config/application.yml
```

Update `config/application.yml`, setting the `github_client_id` and `github_client_secret`.

The environment variables are managed using [figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro).

#### Bootstrapping the Application

If you're on macOS, have Homebrew installed, and you've set the environment variables above to get started just run:
```bash
./script/bootstrap
./script/setup
./script/server
```

Otherwise, no worries! You can follow these instructions to install a local server.

First things first, you'll need to install Ruby. We recommend using the excellent [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv),
and [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build)

```bash
rbenv install
```

Next, you'll need to make sure that you have PostgreSQL installed. On Debian-based Linux distributions you can use apt-get to install Postgres:

```bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev
```

On Windows, you can use the [Chocolatey package manager](http://chocolatey.org/) to install Postgres:

```bash
choco install postgresql
```

Now, let's install the gems from the `Gemfile` ("Gems" are synonymous with libraries in other
languages).

```bash
gem install bundler && rbenv rehash
bundle install
```

Once all the gems are installed, we'll need to create the databases and
tables. Rails makes this easy.

```bash
./bin/setup
```

We can also add some sample data with the **seed** task.

```bash
bundle exec rake db:seed
```

If you are working on anything related to the email-generation code, you can use [MailCatcher](https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher).
Since we use Bundler, please read the [following](https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher#bundler) before using MailCatcher.

Almost there! Now all we have to do is start up the Rails server and point
our browser to <http://localhost:3000>

```bash
./script/server
```

### Newsletter

If you are going to be developing or testing the MailChimp integration, you will need

* a [MailChimp account](https://mailchimp.com)
* an [API key](http://kb.mailchimp.com/integrations/api-integrations/about-api-keys)
* a [list ID](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/manage-contacts/find-your-list-id)

Then you'll need to register the mailchimp-related environment variables in the
`config/application.yml` file.

### Note on Patches/Pull Requests

 * Fork the project.
 * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
 * Add tests for it. This is important so we don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
 * Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
