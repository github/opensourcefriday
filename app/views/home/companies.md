> Audience: Employees of a company that use and depend on open source software (a.k.a. every company that employs developers). Specifically, this page should be a link that people can send their bosses/coworkers/employees to help them learn what open source is, why it's so important to their company, and why their employees should take time to participate in Open Source Friday.

> What are you asking me to do?

Take one day this week to invest in the open source software you use and the community of people that make it great.

> Why should I care?

## Your business depends on it

> What are the reasons companies should care about their employees contributing to and maintaining open source?

- **Improve your technology** - Open source infrastructure is essential to running businesses effectively. Take control rather than relying entirely on others to maintain the software your business depends on.

- **Reduce overhead** - Small, regular contributions to open source allow you to stop maintaining internal versions of open source software in favor of the projects maintaining your patches

- **Build your reputation** - attract relevant developer talent; your engineers create public artifacts, improving their reputation and making you the cool company with fancy famous engineers; aiding community outreach efforts, hiring, and retention.

- **Work Better Together** - Help your employees learn different ways of working that they can bring back into making your organization more efficient.
